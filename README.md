# üìù Todo App - Microservices Architecture

A modern, full-stack todo application built with Go backend, vanilla JavaScript frontend, and PostgreSQL database. Designed as microservices that can be deployed independently.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

```

## üîÑ CI/CD Pipeline

The project includes GitHub Actions workflows in the `.github/workflows` directory for automated testing and deployment. The workflows are triggered on push and pull requests to the main branch.

## üõ†Ô∏è Quick Start

### Using Makefile (Recommended)

The project includes a comprehensive Makefile to simplify development and deployment tasks:

```bash
# Build all Docker images
make build

# Start all services in detached mode
make up

# Stop all services
make down

# View logs from all services
make logs

# Clean up containers, volumes, and images
make clean
```

### Access the Application
- Frontend: http://localhost:3000
- Backend API: http://localhost:8080
- Database: localhost:5432
